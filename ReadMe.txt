This is a thing to export saved variables for addon documentation.

Currently slightly broken due to a cool serializer bug I found.  But hey,
it's something.

The prettydoc program assumes you have mingw and a lua.exe in $PATH.

IF YOU WRITE ME BECAUSE YOU TRIED THIS WITHOUT USING THE PATH TO YOUR
ACTUAL ADDON DIRECTORY, I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU
HAVE EVER LOVED.

./prettydoc pts "/c/games/RIFT PTS/Interface/AddOns"
